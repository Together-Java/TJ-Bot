Jackson is a popular Java library for JSON processing. It provides a simple and efficient way to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up Jackson in a Java project and use it to serialize and deserialize JSON data.

Step 1: Add Jackson Dependency

The first step is to add the Jackson dependency to your project. You can do this by adding the following code to your build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.12.3'
}
```

Step 2: Create Java Objects

Next, we need to create some Java objects that we want to serialize and deserialize as JSON. For example, let's create a simple Person class:

```
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

Step 3: Serialize Java Object to JSON

To serialize a Java object as JSON, we need to create an ObjectMapper object from the com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper class and call its writeValueAsString() method.

```
ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
Person person = new Person("John Doe", 30);
String json = objectMapper.writeValueAsString(person);
System.out.println(json); // {"name":"John Doe","age":30}
```

Step 4: Deserialize JSON to Java Object

To deserialize JSON data into a Java object, we need to call the readValue() method of the ObjectMapper class.

```
String json = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30}";
Person person = objectMapper.readValue(json, Person.class);
System.out.println(person.getName()); // John Doe
System.out.println(person.getAge()); // 30
```

Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to set up Jackson in a Java project and use it to serialize and deserialize JSON data.
Jackson is a powerful library that provides many features for working with JSON data.
With its simple API and efficient performance, it is a great choice for any Java project that needs to work with JSON data.
