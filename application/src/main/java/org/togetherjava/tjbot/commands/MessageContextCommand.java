/**
 * A message context-command is a command, accessible when right-clicking on a message.
 *
 * <p>
 * Represents a Discord message context-command. Mostly decorating
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.interactions.commands.Command}.
 * <p>
 * All message context-commands have to implement this interface. For convenience, there is a
 * {@link BotCommandAdapter} available that implemented most methods already. A new command can then
 * be registered by adding it to {@link Features}.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Context commands can either be visible globally in Discord or just to specific guilds. Minor
 * adjustments can be made via {@link CommandData}, which is then to be returned by
 * {@link #getData()} where the system will then pick it up from.
 * <p>
 * After registration, the system will notify a command whenever one of its corresponding message
 * context-commands ({@link #onMessageContext(MessageContextInteractionEvent)}), buttons
 * ({@link #onButtonClick(ButtonInteractionEvent, List)}) or menus
 * ({@link #onSelectionMenu(SelectMenuInteractionEvent, List)}) have been triggered.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Some example commands are available in {@link org.togetherjava.tjbot.commands.basic}.
