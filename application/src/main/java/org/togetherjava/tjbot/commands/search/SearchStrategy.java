/**
 * <p>
 * A base class for a search Strategy. This allows us to implement multiple variations of a search
 * functionality without having to rewrite any of the main logic (except parsing) used for getting
 * search results. For example in the {@link GoogleSearchStrategy} the Serpapi API is used for
 * fetching results from Google. If we were to change this, we can do by creating a new
 * SearchStrategy and replace the existing call with the new strategy without further code changes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, we now have flexibility to implement searching in other platforms such as
 * Stackoverflow, Yahoo, Bing etc.
