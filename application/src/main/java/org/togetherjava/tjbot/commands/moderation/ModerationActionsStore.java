/**
 * Store for moderation actions, e.g. as banning users. Can be used to retrieve information about
 * past events, such as when a user has been banned the last time.
 *
 * Actions have to be added to the store using
 * {@link #addAction(long, long, long, ModerationUtils.Action, Instant, String)} at the time they
 * are executed and can then be retrieved by methods such as
 * {@link #getActionsByTypeAscending(long, ModerationUtils.Action)} or
 * {@link #findActionByCaseId(int)}.
 *
 * Be aware that timestamps associated with actions, such as {@link ActionRecord#issuedAt()} are
 * slightly off the timestamps used by Discord.
 *
 * The store persists the actions and is thread safe.
