# Tutorial

## Discord Server

As first step, you need to create your own Discord server. This is surprisingly easy.
We use Discord's server template feature for this, this way you don't have to create all the channels, roles and more on your own.
You can still modify the servers channels and roles after creation, as it's only a template.

This can be done using the following [link](https://discord.new/WhtXEUZeFdTg).

1. Open the URL from above
2. Follow the dialog and enter details  
  2.1. Upload a picture  
  2.2. Enter a name  
  2.3. smack the **Create** button
3. boom! you have your own Discord server ðŸŽ‰

# What next?

Now that have your own server and your own Discord bot and both are connected to each other, you can start to create or run an actual bot-program, such as TJ-Bot and give it your bots token!

Once the program has your token, it will connect to the bot and you can interact with it from your server.

You can learn about these steps in the following guide:
